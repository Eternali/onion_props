PROP-PARSER

PROP-PARSER is a simple python module meant to simplify interaction with java .properties files. It provides the benefit of being able to parse properties hierarchically to provide a more robust way of storing properties. Currently it only supports loading a properties file to a dictionary and writing a dictionary to a properties file.


USAGE:

from prop-parser import PropParser
